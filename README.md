## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. In this project, I am using default react testing library.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

Copy the build folder to cloud machine, eg: AWS EC2, GCP Compute, ... (My AWS credit is run out so I don't deploy to it).

Run `serve -s build` in case you want to run static file in the `build` folder.
